before pushing back each token, we first have to do a check, we have 2 cases:
1- the string contains a special char + not surrounded by "" or '' 
(or even smt like : echo "he"llo => hello
  if it has some certain special charachters, it passes, others => error
 example            echo "he"ll%o => hell%o
                    echo "he"ll*o => error
)
one certain thing   echo "whatever chars" does never error
                    echo "lkf"l'    => error (obviously)




last log:       utils.c   => write a function that takes string and char and (return a t_token* if a case like: (fun("-la;pwd;echo"), ';') 
-la;pwd;echo => -la -> ; -> pwd -> ; -> echo )         === V

last log:      solve an issue, it has been screenshoted, a segmentation fault, probaly its the split_str_to_tokens function
